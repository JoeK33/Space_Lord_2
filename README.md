Arcade style shoot-em-up. Released to google play 10/31/2015 

All the game code is in the "core" directory. 

Space Lord 2 is an infinitely scrolling space shooter.  The player is attacked by waves of enemies and bosses. Difficulty increases as the game goes on by introducing new and more dangerous enemies and enemy arrangements.  Players have multiple hit points and can pick up temporary weapon bonuses.  A variety of weapon pickups are available.  Enemies have varied behavior and their arrangements are somewhat random.  Depending on the player's progress in the game, waves are randomly chosen from a set of possible enemies.  This ensures that the player gets to play a "new" game each time they play.

Players can set high scores and unlock 5 score based achievements.  A global leader board is handled by google play.
